## Tasks
Report the following
-   Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of MongoDB and how you resolved
-   Screenshots for:
    -   The correct validation of the installation package (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/verify-mongodb-packages/)
    -   Relevant results obtained during Experiment 1 (it is not necessary to put a single screenshot on each substep, but at least one significant from each CRUD operation).
    -   Experiment 2 example working and the additional Map-reduce operation (and its result) developed by each of you.
-   Reason about why your implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained.
